    <p>so i am trying to explode a innocent capacitor by putting in a LOT of current through it (more than its current rating) such that it would explode. You can read up on this <a href "https://www.instructables.com/Why-Capacitors-Explodes-/" class="custom-link">here</a>. also i feel that it is not a 
    very good idea to search up on too much stuff about it or else they would give me suggestions on "how to escape the watchlist" and stuff... </p>
    <p>anyways here is the very nice circuit diagram that i made. you notice that there is so many batteries because i need to blow up the capacitor. (so we need enough voltage). </p>

    <p>So lemme explain the parts. i need a fuse otherwise maybe sth bad will happen to the batteries after the capacitor explodes and i definitely dont want that to happen.</p>
    <p>Also on the resistor, i put it there such that there wont be too much current through it, so the current surge would only be 3.9A</p>

    <p>and yes, i chose to use a fuse (either a 5A or 4A slow fuse) such that the current surge wont cause it to break</p>
    <p>SO this is my favourite part! The capacitor. I used a 100 micro Farad 16 V rated capacitor cuz it is very small and i actually hope that the capacitor wont blow up VERY violently</p>
